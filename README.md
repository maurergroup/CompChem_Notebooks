# CompChem_Notebooks
--------------------

This repo contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks, which I use for teaching 
in computational chemistry for undergraduate and graduate classes at U Warwick.

Topics include
* Basic Quantum Mechanics (1st year QM)
* Molecular and Solid state chemical bonding concepts (2nd year Solid State)
* Topics of Molecular Modelling (3rd year Molecular Modelling)
* Materials/Interface prediction with Density Functional Theory and Beyond (4th year Adv. Quantum Chemistry)
* Wave function methods (Graduate school class on molecular Modelling)


You can run these notebooks on your own computer if you follow the installation procedures below

# Installation
--------------


## For Win



## For Mac



## For Linux



# Prerequisites
---------------

* Python 3.5 or higher
* Jupyter
* Atomic Simulation Environment 3.15 or higher
* Psi4 
* matplotlib
* numpy/scipy

These requirements are easiest satisfied when using Anaconda or the Psi4 prepacked conda installer (see above).
